# UFOs

# Overview of Project:
    The purpose of the analysis is to create a serchable database of UFO sightings on a web page.


# Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
   The web page is pretty simple. Just input in one of the text boxes on the side to filter the sightings, and then press enter. The results will be filtered on the right. If desired multipule filters can be applied.


# Summary:  In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
    One of the drawbacks of this design is the spelling must be absolutly correct, or else there will be no results.
    A reccomendation for further devlopment would be partial matches should bring up results, also having the results filter dynamically as the imputs are beign typed in.
